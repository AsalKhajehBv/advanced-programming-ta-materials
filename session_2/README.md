# Session 2 Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook builds on the foundational Python concepts introduced in Session 1 and focuses on applying programming logic and problem-solving skills to a series of algorithmic exercises inspired by popular coding challenges.

The notebook includes five structured problems, each designed to reinforce fundamental programming techniques such as iteration, conditionals, string manipulation, list operations, and mathematical reasoning.
